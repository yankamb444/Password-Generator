# Password Generator 
The goal of the project was to create a random password generator using javascript. The user has the option of implementing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters if they choose to. Their password must be between 8 and 128 characters. They will click through a series of prompts that ask them for their selection and input.
